/*
Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n6Ek0RLjDal6Om_VUrum5usHzh76jOudfc7cUcpejdA/edit

where
h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
q is the day of the month.
m is the month (3: March, 4: April, . . ., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
j is the century (i.e.  year1000 ).
k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).
